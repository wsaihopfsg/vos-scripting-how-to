Welcome to VOS Scripting How-To!
================================

The following links describe a set of basic VOS tutorials. Please note that their solution and image files are available in the respective repositories.

.. note::
   While the authors try to be technically correct in these tutorials, the datasheet and manual for VOS in https://www.pepperl-fuchs.com shall provide the final technical adjudication.

You should have downloaded and installed the ``Pepperl-Fuchs Vision Configuration Tool`` as described in the manual. 

The ``VOS emulator`` is the only program that we will be using in this tutorial, which is launched through ``VOS Emulator Config``
